# Get relative scaling factors

Install it using *setup.py* if you prefer not to operate from within this

An example how to invoke these skripts is given in *example_run.py* including

further apart as long as the epicentral distance is large compared to station
distances.

## Things one might want to add:
* SNR checker
* option to make purely synthetic comparison
* verbosity
